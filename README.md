    <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <h3>Research & Problem Discovery</h3>
    <p>We began by researching the pain points in the current educational system in metro cities, focusing on communication gaps and the difficulty students have in discovering opportunities like clubs, extracurricular activities, and career guidance.</p>

    <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
    <p>Using Figma, we designed user flows for three distinct user types—students, parents, and teachers—and created wireframes for each stage of the user journey. We iterated based on feedback and user testing.</p>

    <h3>User Testing & Feedback</h3>
    <p>After creating the initial designs, we conducted testing with students, parents, and teachers to ensure the app’s features addressed their needs and provided a seamless experience.</p>
